      "transcript": " Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q4 2024 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wong, Vice President of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Serendos and Greg Peters and CFO Spence Newman. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. We will now take questions submitted by the analyst community and we will begin with our first question from Dan Salmon of New Street Research. Dan asks, given the need to ensure safety and well-being of CAS and crews, has there been any disruption to your LA-based productions owing to the wildfires? If so, can you please quantify the impact on this year's cash content spending? Thanks, Len, and thanks, Dan. Let me start by saying this is a really difficult time for a lot of people in Southern California. So many people in our industry, including our employees, were deeply impacted by these fires. And the hardest hit areas of these fires, the areas around Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Malibu, are very heavily populated with the folks above and below the line who we work with every single day. So we're doing everything we can to help with with relief and we're getting those folks who can back to work. To your question directly, no meaningful delays in the delivery of the projects and no meaningful impact to the cash to the cash in 25, but very meaningful disruption in people's lives. So our goal is to keep everything on schedule safely, be mindful of folks who need time to work through the challenges of the fires, including in some cases, loss of life and home. But this industry has been through a really tough couple of years, starting with COVID, going into the strikes and now this. So it's really important that we try not to delay anything and try to make sure that these jobs stay safe. I definitely want to add that we are extremely grateful to the firefighters and first responders who are still fighting flames right now. These are the real heroes here. But Dan, to your direct question, no impact in 2025 on cash who are deliverable. Nothing meaningful. Thanks, Ted. We'll take our next question from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Is it fair to assume that most of the upside in the 19 million subscriber additions came from the Jake Paul and the Christmas Day football games? And how was the attrition or retention, I guess, post the Christmas Day games versus normal post-holiday levels? Yeah, short answer to that question is no. At a high level, we've seen broad strength across content categories, across all regions. We've seen it throughout the entire year. And as we've consistently seen across our history, no single title really drives a majority of our acquisition or engagement. So even in an amazing quarter where we had three huge live events, we had an incredible fight, two NFL games, we had one of our biggest TV series ever in Squid Game Season 2, all very successful events and titles that we are thrilled about. Our estimates for subscriber ads driven by those titles combined represent a small minority of our total member acquisition in the quarter. So it's really the whole service that's working that delivered the upside that we saw this quarter. The vast majority of our net ads were driven by our broad slate and our portfolio globally. And Ted, maybe you want to pick it up for the last half of that? Yeah, just putting some color on that. You know, we really have built the business on variety and quality across countries, across regions, across genres. And we really focus that year round of having a very strong slate of programming for our members. So we're thrilled that some folks came in for the fight and some folks came in for the games. But they stuck around for Squid Game and for Carry On and for Black Doves and for 6888 and Senna and Nate Pergetse's new comedy special. All those things all performed really well in the quarter and continue to in the days and weeks after the fight and after the games. And what's really been most encouraging is that the retention behavior of those folks who did come in for those events look a lot like the folks who come in for all of our other big titles. And so I just would add that it's great that all these big swings worked very well in the quarter. But to be able to have that translate into revenue growth meaningfully is everything has to be working. The product, the pricing teams, the marketing, the advertising, all those things have got to be working well. And you said that you'll tend to underperform your margin targets when the dollar is stronger. What FX volatility do you think you can successfully hedge out in 2025? And what are the best ways to estimate the impact of currency movements net of hedging? Sure, Spencer, I will take that one. So roughly 60% of our revenue is in non US dollar currencies. And think of it as the way we look at it is of that amount, we try to hedge roughly 50% on a rolling forward 12 month basis. So, you know, I want to stress that we view hedging as sort of a short to medium term solution at best. Our focus has always been to manage the underlying operating results of the company through natural hedges where we can plus pricing and cost structure over time. So our hedge program is really just a price averaging program to smooth the impact of FX, reduce the volatility from big near term FX moves and avoid short term swings to the business so that we can invest appropriately for both the short and the long term. Thanks, Spence. The next question comes from Brian Pitts of BMO Capital. The advertising user base is growing quickly and your ad tech has been ramping for almost a year. What are your biggest learnings and perhaps hurdles for monetizing monetization in 2025? First and foremost, we love our ads plan because it allows us to offer a lower price point for consumers. That's more choice, good accessibility that is proving to be popular and it means that we obviously have more people that can sign up and enjoy the growing range of entertainment that we've got to offer. It's also the reason that we've been successful in driving that first ads priority we had in our ads goals, our most primary ads goals, which were to get to sufficient scale. So Q4 ads plan represented over 55% of signups across our ads countries. We've seen membership on those ads plan increase about 30% quarter over quarters last quarter. That was on top of 35%. The quarter before on top of significant growth, the quarters before that. So as you point out, we've seen significant growth since launch, which we're excited about. Maybe even more excited about the fact that the engagement of those ads members remains healthy. So view hours per member on the ads plan is similar to engagement on our standard non ads plan in our ads country, which is a really good marker that we're excited about. So we've done the work, I would say to meet our scale goals for advertisers in 25. And that means that increasingly we've been able to shift more of our focus, more of our attention on making the offering better for advertisers to increase monetization of that growing inventory. This is going to remain a priority and part of our roadmap for at least the next several years, likely years to come after that. But we're making solid progress already. For example, we exceeded our ads revenue target in Q4, which was an exciting milestone to get. We doubled our ads revenue year over year last year. We expect to double it again this year, so that should give you a sense of the slope of monetization growth that we're on. Broadly, we think of this as we're making solid progress. There's considerable work ahead of us for sure, but we don't see specific hurdles that you mentioned in the question, other than just doing the. So we think our path is relatively straightforward and we're confident we've got a significant runway to continue to grow that revenue. Great. And we have a follow up question on advertising from Jessica Reif-Ehrlich of Bank of America. On advertising, do you have all the tech and tools you need to significantly scale up and move from the crawl to walk phase? Yeah, I think you can say that 2025 is the year that we transitioned from crawl to walk. A big part of that is standing up our own ads deck. We launched that in Canada and that's gone well. We're testing, we're learning quickly as we prepare to then roll that out in 2025 across the rest of our 12 ads countries, starting with the US in April. And the biggest initial benefit we have of using our own ad server is just enabling us to offer more flexibility, more ways of buying for advertisers, fewer activation hurdles, just improving the overall buyer experience. And of course, that is meant to drive increased sales and the ease of transacting with Netflix. And we're already seeing the impact of those benefits in the revenue growth in Canada. So that's exciting and improves our optimism around it. And then over time, the first party iTech platform allows us to deliver more critical capabilities to advertisers that we hear from them that they really need. So more programmatic availability, we're talking enhanced targeting, we're leveraging more data sources, more measurement, more reporting, more incrementality studies. So being on our own tech stack enables all those advertising features, advertiser facing features. But the other big benefit is that it just creates a higher quality experience for our members. So it increases relevance. That's good for them. It's good for advertisers. It's good for us. It's good for everybody in the ecosystem, essentially. Just so, you know, to reiterate, we got many years of building ahead of us. The roadmap is clear. We're committed to iterative innovation and advertising, just as you've seen us do in many other places. And as I mentioned before, while we've got tons of work, we feel the path for the next several years, at least, is fairly straightforward. And we're confident we can continue to grow revenue at a solid pace and earn a growing piece of that over $25 billion in CTV ad spend. Awesome. Thanks, Greg. I'll now shift to a couple of content related questions from analysts. The first is from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. He asked, Ted, do the strong viewing numbers for the NFL games leave you more interested in full season sports rights for Netflix, or do you still see full season sports rights as generally unattractive for Netflix? Well, let me start with the viewing of the NFL games, which there are in-season games and they're the two most streamed NFL games ever. The average minute audience for those games were 30 and 31 million. It's phenomenal. And Beyonce also set a very high bar for future halftime shows, even for the Super Bowl. So we're really thrilled with the viewing. We're thrilled with everything about it. All that being said, we are constantly trying to broaden our programming and live events is one of those things and sports is part of those live events. So when I look at this and say, that's a really fantastic thing, but it doesn't really change the underlying economics of full-season big league sports being extremely challenging. If there was a path where we could actually make the economics work for both us and the league, we certainly would explore. Right now, we believe that the live events business is where we really want to be, and sports is a very important part of that, but it is a part of that expansion. Thanks, Ted. And Rich Greenfield from Lightshed has a similar follow-up question. Has the fight and WWE Raw results influenced your decision process on additional rights like the UFC? Yeah, well, not going to comment anything specifically like the UFC, but WWE is off to a great start. Our first week, we drew about five million views, which is about two times the audience that Monday Night Raw was getting in linear television. Pretty consistent with how we modeled it. We'd hoped to build the audience for the league. We also saw that the non-live viewing, so in the day after the live event, our viewing grew by 25%, mostly outside of the U.S. time zones. So this is a new viewing in the UK, in Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, particularly big markets. So we're really thrilled to see how that's going so far. In the U.S., our viewing of Monday Night Raw was as big as the Monday Night Raw viewing has been in five years. So we're super thrilled about how that's going and how that's coming out. Again, just, you know, not to be overly repetitive, but we're going to be mindful of the bottom line. And it's really important that those economics do work and that the big league sports, full league, full season economics are very hard to make work. And so for us, we want to be able to bring value to the sport like we have to date with WWE certainly, but like we have with the NFL too, where we were basically able to bring a big audience, a young audience, a more global audience than linear television, but that has to be reflected in the deal as well. Thanks, Ed. And that's a good segue to our last question on sports to round it out from Vikram of Baird. Could you elaborate on the decision to acquire rights to the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, 2031? What were the features of the event that made it attractive and how does this fit into your broader strategy for live sports? I think it fits perfectly into the strategy. Women's World Cup is a real TV event, totally consistent with what we're trying to do here. These matches set a bunch of viewing records in twenty twenty three and women's sports have only become more interesting and more popular since it's month-long event filled with drama played by some of the greatest athletes in the world. We're thrilled to be the home for those games in 2020, starting in 2027. And we're thrilled to have the time to start telling the stories of these teams and these athletes, like we've done so well with other sports, with our series and our documentaries. Great. Another question from Rich Greenfield of Light Shed Partners. Did Carry On prove that movies can break through without a theatrical release? In less than two months, Carry On was well-reviewed and has racked up 313 million view hours and the film generated significant buzz across social media and is set to surpass Bird Box viewership. Was there an unusually high level of marketing spend for this film or did the buzz build organically on Netflix? This was a great example, I think, of a movie born on Netflix that can generate an enormous audience and tons of buzz. In fact, one of the producers called me over the break to tell me that this is exactly what it feels like when I have a big movie in the theaters, which was a great thing to hear. And we even got injected into the debate, the age-old is Die Hard, a Christmas movie debate, and is carrying on the new Die Hard, which is, we're definitely in the zeitgeist, in the culture, drawing a big audience for a movie that premiered on Netflix and had a very modest marketing spend like we typically do. And I think it actually draws a lot of attention to how powerful the platform is to promote to our own members, how Netflix can talk to our members where they are, which is on Netflix to tell them about a great new movie they're going to love. And then we have our social channels with over a billion subscribers that actually keep that conversation going. So I think it's a really strong proof point that a movie born on Netflix can be a big hit and be the center of culture as well. Thanks, Ted. And for the record, I do think both Die Hard and Harry on are Christmas movies. To be continued, to be continued. And I think that's a great segue to Doug and this question from JP Morgan. Ted, does the agreement to debut Narnia in the theater in 2026, 2026 suggest any shift in your overall theatrical strategy? No change at all to our theatrical strategy. Our core strategy is to give our members exclusive first-run movies on Netflix. The Narnia IMAX release is a release tactic. We routinely release movies and theaters a couple of weeks before to qualify for awards, to meet festival requirements, and to prime the publicity pump a bit. In the case of Narnia, it's a two-week special event. I think it's very differentiated from other runs because I doubt anyone has a screen as big as an IMAX screen at home. So it is kind of a differentiated consumer experience. But we've done variants of these releases many times. And doing it with IMAX kind of greatly simplifies our release process as well. But mostly I want to say I'm incredibly excited to be working with Greta on this movie. We're super excited to get it into production so we can talk about how great this movie is more so than which screens it's on. She's an incredible director and this is a really exciting project. Right. Our next question comes from Vikram from Baird and it's about plans and pricing. How do you plan to approach the cadence and magnitude of price increases going forward, particularly in your largest markets? What are the signals that inform those decisions across the different regions and plans? I could take this one. Our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. It's pretty much the same as we've talked about for the last several years. Of course, we look to continually provide more value to our members, seeking to wisely invest to increase the variety and quality of our entertainment offering. And then we listen to those members. We listen for signals like engagement, retention, acquisition. There's more secondary signals as well, all to tell us when we've achieved that increase in value. And when we've done that, then we ask them to pay a bit more to keep that virtuous cycle going. You've seen us take a price across a number of markets in EMEA and APAC and LATAM over the last couple of quarters across most plans and including ads too. And those changes have gone smoothly. You can see those in our results. We certainly expect the same for these latest changes. And I think it's worth noting and reiterating that we believe that our starting price, $7.99 in the US, $79 Canadian in Canada, four standard with ads, is an incredible entertainment value. And it's a highly accessible entry point. So ultimately, we feel really good about our long-term monetization opportunity. We earn, right now, only 6% of the revenue opportunity in the countries and segments that we currently serve. And as long as we continue to deliver on improving the variety, the quality of our TV and film slate, we gradually expand the offering with newer content types, we'll believe we'll be able to increase that share progressively every year. If I could just chime in on you, Greg, I just, you know, when you're going to ask for a price increase, you better make sure you have the goods and the engagement to back it up. And I feel like what we have going into 2025 is just that we have the returning seasons of our biggest shows ever. Wednesday, Stranger Things and Squid Game, Night Agent, Ryan Murphy's Monster, You, Alice in Borderland from Japan, Delhi Crime from India, New Seasons to Drive to Survive. And on the film side, we've got new movies from Oscar winners like Guillermo del Toro, Catherine Bigelow, Noah Baumbach, the Russo Brothers new film, Happy Gilmore 2, a new Knives Out film. And live, obviously, we've got the SAG Awards next month, Christmas Day football, Monday Night Raw every Monday night, and a few surprises there too. So I definitely feel like The Strength of Slade has never been better. Great. I'm going to now turn to a few questions on engagement. So our first one comes from Peter Sapino of Wolf Research. Engagement is stable based on data from third-party panels. Is engagement growth a strategic priority for Netflix? Absolutely. And I think we look at this and say what we're trying to do is entertain the world. And you measure that and how are people pushing play and sticking around for the things that they love. And Bella and her team are really kind of programming into those moments of breadth and of quality and trying to meet people where they are, finding something for everybody and something for every mood in every language and every part of the world. It's tough work that they have cut out for them, but they're doing the job of winning over those moments every night and getting people who spend right now at about 200 billion of hours of programming or streaming last year, our average members watching for about two hours a day. So we've still got plenty of work to do to grow that. And that's what the team is very highly focused on. Not surprisingly, I would say we consistently see that, you know, engagement improvements, engagement are correlated with the other key business drivers that we have. So it obviously drives retention, acquisition, etc. And so we're excited that we've seen, you know, continuing growth and engagement and look forward to more of that. Spence? Well, you hit it. It's it all start. We talk about it a lot. The flywheel starts with engagement. It's engagement, revenue, profit, and drives the flywheel. And the rest of the numbers are points you hit on, I think, other than maybe one other is just to kind of note that as a reminder in the letter, we talked about the fact that we will now going forward twice a year on the same day as earnings release our engagement report starting with our Q2. So in July, our earnings report will also include our engagement report just to emphasize that kind of a steady drum beat with earnings and with our performance. And to get a little more granular even sooner Our next engagement report is going to publish in february. So it's the next month Great and then our um, second question on engagement is a little bit broader. It's from justin patterson of key bank What are the key steps to competing more with short form video platforms for engagement? Well, the the our goal here is to entertain all audiences, including younger audiences who may be watching disproportionately more short-form content. Now, the beauty is that those folks all love film and TV shows as well. So we're constantly entertaining them with projects that get them so excited that they push play. They stick around. They go on their social media accounts and talk about the shows. They do tributes to the shows. You see how many... When do you see the new season? When Wednesday comes out, you're going to see all the social media platforms get flooded with tributes to this work. Our core is kind of professional longer form storytelling, and that's a very big and enduring business. But again, as things get pulled, as eyeballs get pulled into other places, we definitely want to be there for them as well. I do find that the short form services also are a great breeding ground for new storytellers. So you see, we're super excited to bring Miss Rachel over onto Netflix. Parents are excited about that too. But we also have got a rich history of finding projects in other places and having them up the game and be very successful on Netflix. Things like Cobra Kai and Cocoa Melon and Somebody Feed Phil, which is now shooting its eighth season. So I feel like the work we have to do there is to win over audiences with programming that they love. If it's Heartstopper or Stranger Things or Ginny and Georgia, Elite, Outer Banks, that's what we have to do. We have to out-compete for those moments of entertainment truth. I think consistent with that and just expanding on it, I think we see ourselves as playing a specific and differentiated role in the ecosystem. So whether it's being a place where those great storytellers that Ted mentioned can graduate to, whether it's from places like YouTube or the theater or any other place that they come from. We know that consumers want a spot to enjoy great movies and TV shows, to have a user interface and user experience which designed specifically around that. We know that our creative partners need someone that can participate in investing in those to share the risk that's inherent in bringing those stories to life. So we, you know, want to double down on supporting that part of the ecosystem. And, you know, we want to make sure that shows like Stranger Things or Wednesday or Heartstopper, Outer Banks, which, you know, have huge viewing and fandom, especially with those younger audiences, continue to have a place to be found, loved and enjoyed. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Gould of Loop Capital. How do you assess your progress in the video game space? How have the engagement trends been? When do you anticipate video games will have an impact on subscriber growth or retention? Okay, so a lot there. I'd say we've learned quite a bit and made some good early progress since we've launched games. We've, of course, launched a bunch of games with some highlights amongst them. The critically claimed Oxenfree 2 stands out, certainly Grand Theft Auto, where we drove tens of millions of downloads. We've got fan favorites based on Netflix IP, things like Too Hot to Handle, Emily in Paris, Selling Sunset, and to our latest big release, Squid Game Unleashed, which we really think validates our Netflix game formula, which is enabling this virtuous cycle between linear content and simultaneous game offerings. And we are just scratching the surface today in terms of what we can ultimately do in that space. But we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the universe and a story, but also creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the non-interactive side. So, based on all of those learnings, and under the leadership of Land Tuscan, we continue to refine our strategy. And we're going to be focusing on more narrative games based on Netflix IP. These are consistent fan favorites, and we've got a lot in the library to work with there. We'll also be introducing party and couch co-op games on the TV delivered from the cloud. We think of this as a successor to family board game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be. So we're excited about delivering some cool experiences in that space. We'll deliver games for kids. This is no ads, no in-app payments. It's a safe space for kids just included with your subscription. And of course, we want to do more recognizable mainstream titles, whether that is licensed titles like GTA. And we're going to have more of those big licensed titles to come that we're looking forward to, as well as homegrown titles based on our IP like Squid Game Unleashed, which I'll just reiterate, you know, Squid Game Unleashed reached number one in action games in the app stores in 107 countries. It's on pace to become our most downloaded game. And so to your question about impacts on the subscriber side, we already see positive impacts in acquisition and retention from our game playing members. Now, those effects are relatively small currently, but frankly, so is our investment in games relative to our overall content budget. And we're going to stay disciplined about scaling that investment as we see continued scaling and member benefits. So to try and summarize, there's plenty more to do in this space, but we're breaking into a whole new content category, which, by the way, drives approximately $140 billion in consumer spend, ex-China, ex-Russia, and not even including the ad revenue. So we're iteratively showing our members that we are a place to discover and play games, and we look forward to continuing to launch bigger and bigger games every year. Thanks, Greg. We have a couple of late-breaking questions on the forecast that analysts have submitted, so I'll wrap up with two of those questions. This comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. You spent roughly $17 billion on cash content spending in 2024 and will spend about $18 billion in 2025. How should investors think about long-term spending levels? Is there a point where you reach an equilibrium where you don't need to increase spend beyond inflation? Want me to take that? Sure. Sure, I'll take that one. I think we're a long way from equilibrium. As you say, we're taking up our cash content spend this year, estimated from 17 to 18 billion. That's in the context of we're small in terms of view share and penetration everywhere around the world. We're less than 50% penetrated into connected households. You heard from Greg that we're only capturing about 6% of our estimated revenue market. So we have a long way to grow. It's really about where do we put the next billion dollars and then beyond that to work in the most impactful way over Over the next year or so, you'll see that in areas like continuing to build into big scripted TV series. As you heard from Ted, we're continuing to build out live. We're continuing to build out our original programming in each of our regions around the world and also seeing more and more kind of impactful licensing opportunities. And I think we kind of grow from there. So the opportunity, there's a long runway to continue to grow. We do it in a disciplined way, right? So we kind of set our growth based on our top line growth and our margin targets. And then we kind of allocate as we can across the business for highest impact. And I think you've seen us do that in a responsible way where our, you know, our cash spend and our content cash amortization is sort of a 1.1 ratio roughly plus or minus between our content amort which runs through the P&L and the cash spend which runs through cash flow and both are growing slower than our revenue growth. So I think you should see us continuing to grow in that way for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow more and more engagement and please more and more hopefully growing audience around the world. Thanks, Spence. And our last question comes from John Blackledge of TD Cowan. Can you please talk about the drivers of raising your 2025 operating margin guidance? What are the biggest points of leverage driving higher margins this year? Spence, you want to take that? Yeah, sure. So, you know, we're always kind of looking to balance our revenue growth with strategic investment into the business. And we think we've balanced that well this year. You see, we guided to 12 to 14 percent top line revenue growth. If you kind of do the read through in terms of based on our margin guidance what that we would expect in terms of our implied expense growth you can see it's sort of high single digit you know nine percent plus or minus expense growth expected for 2025 and if you that down, we're expecting sort of high single digit, roughly content amortization growth. So still below revenue growth. So some margin there. And that's based on, again, that 18 billion of plus or minus expected content cash spend. And the amort moves around a bit based on the timing of titles and releases, but high single digits, a pretty good estimate. And then we're investing into our growth priorities. We're pretty heavily investing into our product and engineering teams to build out ads and live and games capabilities and also our new user interface to enhance our product discovery. We're also investing in the marketing and sales line, mostly on the sales side as we build out our ad sales organization and go to market capabilities. And beyond that, our support areas are kind of growing sort of mid, low, single digits. So across the board, for the most part, we're driving a margin improvement in a way that we think is appropriate for the business while investing into our growth. Great. Thank you, Spence. And thank you all for joining us for our Q4 earnings call. And we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thanks very much.",

      "transcript": " Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q1 2025 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wong, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters and CFO, Spence Newman. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. We'll now take questions from the analyst community and we will begin first with our results, outlook and forecast. And our first question comes from Robert Fishman of Moffitt Nathanson. Robert's question is the Wall Street Journal report this week discussed Netflix's internal goal of doubling revenue and tripling operating income by 2030. How should investors think about Netflix leaning into more content spending over the next five years? I'll take this. And thanks, Robert. Look, we have a unique culture. And part of it is this open information operating style. And it has served us very, very well. On rare and very disappointing occasions, our confidential and internal discussions can leak into the press. And while we wouldn't normally comment about leaked internal information, we do want to be extra clear about this. We often have internal meetings and we talk about long-term aspirations, but it's important to note that this is not the same as forecast. Our operating plans is the same as our external forecasting guidance. We don't have a five-year forecast or five-year guidance, but you can assume that we are long-range thinking and that we're working hard every day to build the most loved and valued entertainment company for all of our stakeholders. And maybe to pivot the conversation to what we're happy to comment on and discuss in detail. You know, we do have big long-term aspirations and those aspirations are really grounded in the potential for growth that we see in the business. Now, we think we got a pretty good business today, you know, over 40 billion in revenue. We've got over 300 million paid households. Those represent an audience of over 700 million individuals. We're leading in streaming view share, but we also think that we're a minority of our addressable market, our potential across any of those measures. So you think about engagement, you know, we're less than 10% of TV hours from an audience or connected households perspective. We still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up. And from a revenue perspective, you know, we're about 6% of consumer spend and ad revenue in the countries we serve in the areas that we serve. So we believe we've got plenty of room to grow our engagement, our revenue, and our profit. And as Ted said, you know, do that to become the most valued and loved entertainment company for all of our stakeholders. Thanks, Ted and Greg. Our next question, or I should say we have received several questions actually, understandably, about the economic environment and consumer sentiment as well. For example, Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer asks, this is the first time you are potentially entering a recession with a low cost ad plan. How do you think about consumers downgrading plans relative to the behavior you've seen in prior recessions? Yeah, given that we've got a bunch of questions on sort of the general economic environment, maybe just start with some comments on that. We're paying close attention clearly to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving. But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note. So what are we looking at? Primary metrics and indicators would be our retention that's stable and strong. We haven't seen any significant changes in plan mix or plan take rate to part of that question. Our most recent price changes have been in line with expectations. Engagement remains strong and healthy. So things generally look stable from that lens. Stepping back, we also take some comfort in the fact that entertainment historically has been pretty resilient in tougher economic times. Netflix specifically also has been generally quite resilient and we haven't seen any major impacts during those tougher times, albeit of course, over a much shorter history. And then to the point of the specific question, I think that having the low-cost ads plan in our largest markets also gives us more resilience. And we think that we represent an incredible entertainment value, starting at $7.99 in the US and Canada with the ads plan. It's an accessible price point and we really do expect the demand for entertainment to remain strong. Yeah, and just to add to that, Greg, a bit, you know, we remain focused on the things that we can control and improving the value of Netflix is the big one. Historically in tougher economies, home entertainment value is really important to consumer households and Netflix is a tremendous value in absolute terms and certainly in competitive terms. So there are some international risks that folks talk about what's happening now. And I'd say, look, there always has been. We pay taxes and levies around the world, consistent with all sorts of local regulations. And so there's always some of that that has existed, always has. But what we're seeing today, we're not changing anything in the forecast. So kind of keep in mind that while the US represents our largest spend for content and employees, production infrastructure, we produce original content in 50 countries around the world. And we're a net contributor to many of those economies and cultures. So in our letter, we talked about our commitment to the UK. We also recently announced a billion dollar commitment to production in Mexico. In 2023, we announced we were two and a half billion and committed to Korean content in Korea. And all of these are just examples of the global commitment. So when we produce in these countries, we create and support employment and training. We work with local producers and local talent. We help export local stories and local cultures around the world. We even drive tourism. So we believe we're additive to the local economies and the local cultures all around the world where we're working. So perhaps a little bit less exposed. Thanks, Ted. So that sort of takes care of the question we got from Dan Salmon specifically on tariffs as well. So I'll move us along to a question now from Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners. Does your price increase cadence change due to the global economic uncertainty or is that outweighed by the strength of your slate and increased time spent watching Netflix? Yeah, it really links to how we think about price changes. As we stated before, we really rely on our members to let us know when we've invested enough, grown the value in our offering, and then determine based on that when we adjust pricing to be able to reinvest back into our service. So we're going to continue to follow that philosophy and that path rather than some predetermined plan. We certainly seen periods of challenging economic conditions historically in different countries, and we've generally been able to keep that positive flywheel spinning, in those situations. And I think that that speaks to the gap between value and price, and that we are, for many people, a very good value, even as they're being careful about where they spend. We've also been expanding that range of price points, including the low-priced ads plan in our ads market, which better allows us to offer the right plan at the right price to a wider range of consumers. So that's all to say that we're proceeding largely as we've done in the past while continuing to work to improve both value and accessibility. Great. Thanks, Greg. Our next question is from John Hoodlick of UBS. How has member retention been trending given the Q4 strong paid net additions? Have you retained the bulk of these subscribers? And can you give us a sense of how churn has been trending? Yeah, sure. Spencer, why don't I take that one, give Greg and Ted a break for a sec. You know, as Greg mentioned, we're seeing strong, stable acquisition and retention trends in the business generally. That resulted in healthy member growth in Q1. Last quarter, we did provide some color on the retention characteristics for some of those bigger live events in Q4. Recall we had the Paul Tyson fight, we had NFL on Christmas Day, and we also had Squid Game, which was an event in and of itself. But we did mention at the time that those three big events were still a minority, a small minority of our net ads in Q4. But we also noted that the retention characteristics for the members that came in for those big events was similar to members that joined for other big titles. And that continues to be the case. So really no meaningful changes to our retention story, which no news on that front is good news from our perspective. Thanks, Spence. We have another question about our outlook and forecast from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Given the strength in operating margins in the first half of the year, can you discuss the key incremental costs that will drive lower margins in the second half? Do you expect these costs to be more heavily weighted to the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Spence? Yeah, I'll take it again. OK, thanks, Michael. So as you've seen in our letter and as you mentioned, we're still forecasting 29%, 29% full-year margin, operating margin for the year. And we primarily managed a full-year margin. As you know, our margins bounce around a bit quarter to quarter. That's usually based on the timing of our content slate. That's the primary driver. And that's what's reflected in our forecast. So content expense, we expect it'll grow and ramp in Q3 and Q4 on a year over year basis, given the timing of our slate. We've got our biggest titles returning in the back half of the year. I'm sure Ted will talk to some of that later in the call. And also typically in Q4, we have a heavier film slate. We've also got sales and marketing expenses that we expect would ramp in the second half of the year, both to support the slate, but also add sales. The go-to-market operations are hitting in our marketing and sales line. We're continuing to build out our sales operations and capabilities, and some of that is hitting there and growing in the back half. So all of that is expected and reflected in our guidance. Other than, as I said, a little bit of a heavier slate, typically on the film side in Q4, no meaningful differences between Q3 and Q4. You know, the one thing maybe I'll also just add, Spencer, is we obviously beat a bit in operating income in Q1, but at this point, most of that was a little bit on the revenue side, mostly on the expense side. And it looks to us that most of that was timing of spend, but still spend that we would expect to hit in the full year. So there's still a long ways to go in the year. Good bit of macro uncertainty out there. So this is still our best estimate for kind of outlook for the year. Thanks, Spence. I'll move us along now to a set of questions around advertising from Dan Salmond of New Street Research. Does the current macro environment change your approach to the television upfronts? Any broad thoughts on how you're approaching upfront versus the scatter market would be great. Sure. Similar to commentary on the consumer sentiment, we're keeping a close eye on the marketplace, but we aren't currently seeing any signs of softness from our direct interactions with buyers. Actually, to the opposite, we're seeing some positive indicators from clients as we approach our upfront event. I think worth noting perhaps that the fact that we're currently relatively small in ads, and that's sort of ads as a revenue contributor to Netflix, but probably more importantly, the amount of ad spend that we're seeking to win relative to the big ads pie, that smallness probably provides us some insulation to market shifts right now. And we are rolling out our proprietary ad tech suite. We've rolled that out in Canada and the United States. We've got our remaining 10 markets coming. That offers a bunch of new capabilities that advertisers have told us they want. So we're just starting to sell into those new capabilities that opens up new opportunities for us, opens up new demand for us as well. So I would say based on everything that we're seeing right now, we continue to expect that we will roughly double our advertising revenue in 2025 through a combination of both upfronts, programmatic expansion and scatter. Thanks, Greg. And that's a very good segue to our next question, which comes from Vikram of Baird. Could you provide an update on your first party ad tech platform? How has the rollout in Canada performed relative to your expectations? And do you have any observations so far in the U.S.? Yeah, it's a big milestone for us to roll out our own ad suite. We've been working on it for a while. We're still in the middle of that rollout, but our Canada and US launches have gone well, consistent with our expectations. We're learning and improving quickly now based on the feedback we're getting from having those live and operating them. Then we'll roll out across the remaining 10 ads markets in a few stages over the coming months. So that's sort of all lined up and ready to go. The biggest initial benefit that we are seeing, again, as expected from being on our own ad servers, it just enables more flexibility for advertisers, more ways that they can buy. There's fewer activation hurdles. We have the ability to improve that overall buyer experience iteratively. It just makes it easier to transact with Netflix. And that, of course, drives increased sales. And so we're seeing that. And then we expect over time that our first party ad tech platform will allow us to do other things, deliver more critical capabilities more quickly to advertisers. These are things like more programmatic availability, something we definitely hear demand for, enhanced targeting, something we're excited about. We can leverage more data sources. And of course, something we hear all the time, more measurement and reporting capabilities. So those are all things that we've got in work. Some of those have been delivered already in some of the territories and those will come over time. And then the other big space of benefit by being on our own tech stack is it enables us to have more control to create a higher quality ad experience for our members. This is things that are really important, like increasing ad relevance, which is good for everybody in the whole ecosystem. So just getting started. Excited to get it out there. We got many years of building ahead of us, but we've got a clear roadmap. We know what we're committed to, and we'll just continually, iteratively improve and innovate in advertising, just like you've seen us do in all sorts of other areas. Thanks, Greg. And speaking of ads relevance, Justin Patterson has a longer term question on ads. Netflix has solved personalized content recommendations. What are the key steps to solving ad content recommendations or relevance? In which inning do you believe you're in? Not sure I would characterize this completely solved. We hope that we can be even better day to day in recommending the main titles. But we do have an ambition to achieve that same level of sophistication and maturity capability that we did on the personalized recommendations in the ad space. So that means matching the right ad with the right audience, the right viewer, and the right title. And we think putting those three things together drives superior campaign outcomes for advertisers. We think it's a better experience for members, so it's win-win-win. Where are we at in that process? I would say that we are literally just beginning to get that going. The first stage of that is actually being on our own ads platform. We've launched that, as I said, in Canada, the US. We've got the remaining markets coming over the next months to come. And in doing that during this time, we've been able to significantly already expand our targeting capabilities. So that now includes targeting features that are based on Netflix unique data. So think life stage, interest, viewing mood. In the US, we've also recently enabled advertisers to do more significant targeting. So this is targeting on their own onboarded audiences, targeting on Netflix modeled audiences, targeting against audience segments that are provided by a select set of third party vendors. So we've got a lot of exciting work going on in that space. And then looking ahead, in 2026, we'll do more of that, more data targeting capabilities. We'll move more of that globally. So a lot of things we do, we start in the United States and expand across more territories. You'll see that. And then, of course, more measurement functionality in all markets. And then in 2027, when we get to look to specific focused investments at a higher order and data capabilities such as ML-based optimizations, we've got advanced measurement, advanced targeting, we'll be really opening a rich space there. Another big benefit we get on our own ad stack is we'll be able to innovate and develop more quickly new ad formats so we have more spaces that we can point all of that improved targeting capability against. So just getting started in this space, we got a lot of work to do for sure. But we think we'll be able to move very quickly and frankly, more quickly than other streamers, because we believe we're going to be able to leverage not only pre-existing tech that we have, data that we have, but also data science expertise and the rapid product innovation experience where we're at. Thanks, Greg. I'll move us along to a series of content related questions from analysts, beginning with Rich Greenfield from Lightshed. There are four major sports properties available right now. How should we think about the strategic fit for Netflix in terms of number one, the UFC, number two, WWE premium live events, number three, F1, and number four, Major League Baseball. Thanks, Rich. I do want to remind you that our live strategy is beyond just sports. So I'm not going to comment on any of those specific opportunities at this time, but I will steer you back to the letter to show you that our live event strategy is unchanged and we remain really focused on the big breakthrough events. Our audiences love them. And so anything we chase and the event space or the sports space is a deal that have to make economic sense as well. So live is a relatively small part of our content spend. We have about 200 billion view hours, so small relative to view hours too. But that being said, all viewing is not equal. What we have seen with live is this very outsized positives around conversation and acquisition, and we suspect retention. And we're really excited to keep building on that. We have the Taylor-Serrano fight in July. That's a rematch from when they fought the first time on the Tyson-Paul fight night. It was most watched women's sporting event in us history. So there's a lot of excitement around that. Uh, the NFL of course is a great property and we're happy to have the Christmas day games. So we opted into the second NFL game for Christmas day. So we'll be presenting all day football again on December 25th, 2025, really exciting. Uh, and then today our live adventures have all been primarily in the US, but we intend to grow the capability to do it around the world in the years ahead. So very pleased with the progress so far and excited about the future for live sports and non-sports. Thanks, Ted. The next question is from Matt Thornton of FBN Securities. Do you think video podcasts could perform well as a category on Netflix? So we're constantly looking at all different types of content and content creators. The lines between podcasts and talk shows are getting pretty blurry. We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love. And podcasts, to your point, have become a lot more video forward. And today we actually produce a lot of podcasts ourselves as part of our kind of publicity and publishing efforts. So some are really show specific, like Squid Game and Diplomat. Some are genre focused. Some are talent focused. We have a great one called You Can't Make This Up, all about Netflix docs. And they live everywhere podcasts live today. But as the popularity of video podcasts grow, I suspect you'll see some of them find their way to Netflix. Thanks, Ted. From Rich Greenfield again, how do you create iconic animated franchises? What does it really take to build out culturally relevant animated IP? Is the answer a different team, acquisitions, or something else entirely? Well, thanks, Rich. Keep in mind, we're relatively new at this, and it's a completely creative process. We've had some hits, and we've also had some misses, so we know we have work to do. But I would point out that we've had some really nice hits with Leo, with Sea Beast, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, certainly Pierce Culture, even won the Oscar for us for best animated feature film. And the other thing to keep in mind about why we're excited about this space, there's a lot of demand for animated film. In 2024, nine out of the top 10 most streamed movies were animated features. So just like in our live action strategy, we want to make some, we want to license some, and we have more access today to license than we did when we began in-house animation. And we get to that now through output deals with Universal, Illumination, and with Sony. But the animation team, Hannah and Dan, they're working really hard on a very promising slate of exclusive originals that are going to roll out through 2027, including one called In Your Dreams coming out in Q4, which is really fun, really entertaining, beautifully produced film that I think you're going to love. So we got our work cut out for us, but it's a big prize. Thanks, Ted. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman of Moffitt and Nathanson. As you think about the competitive landscape over the next five years, should investors expect Netflix to move into short form or creator led content to compete head to head with YouTube? Sure, I'll kick this one off. I think just starting at the macro lens, we've always had very strong competitors, including YouTube, many others. We're all definitely competing hard for people's entertainment time. So we absolutely have to earn every hour that we win. We don't take anything for granted. We don't get anything for free. We wake up every day eager to improve our service for our members and for members to be. We also think in that broadest competitive lens that the biggest opportunity we've got is actually going after the roughly 80% share of TV time that neither Netflix nor YouTube have today. We think of that as a real immediate opportunity. And then when it comes to the specific head-to-head competition with YouTube or other platforms like YouTube, we believe we are a more competitive, better service for a certain class of creators and certain types of storytelling. And most importantly in that is that we lead monetization for those kinds of titles. And that means we can provide a better opportunity than YouTube or other services for those creators and those stories. And Ted, maybe you want to comment on the creator and content type expansion. Yeah, sure. You know, we're looking for the next generation of great creators and we're looking everywhere. So not just in film schools and certainly not just in Hollywood. Creators today have tools that were unimaginable a decade ago, you know, to tell stories, to reach audience. You know, the question is out there is that is it premium? Well, some of it is. And we believe we have the best monetization model on the planet for premium storytelling. I think we can help those creators reach an audience. Our model can also support more ambitious efforts for them, can help de-risk them, unlike the kind of typical UGC models. Look at folks like Miss Rachel. She's been in the top 10 every week since she launched on Netflix. Kill Tony right now is killing it with our stand-up fans. We're working with Sidemen. We just launched Pop the Balloon. So we think it's really exciting. When you put this all together, we believe it's the best place for premium content as defined by fans and the best home for storytos, Jim Cameron, et cetera, begin embracing the technology. What is Netflix doing to leverage AI for its creative partners? How meaningful can this be? And are there any examples that you can share? Well, Ben, there's a ton of excitement about what AI can do for content creators. I read the article too, Jim Cameron said, about making movies 50% cheaper. I remain convinced that there's an even bigger opportunity if you can make movies 10% better. So our talent today is using AI tools to do set references or previs, VFX sequence prep, shot planning, all kinds of things today that kind of make the process better. Traditionally, only big budget projects would have access to things like advanced visual effects, such as de-aging. So today, you can use these AI-powered tools to enable smaller budget projects to have access to big VFX on screen. A recent example that I think is really exciting, Rodrigo Prieto was the DP on The Irishman just five years ago. And if you remember that movie, we were using very cutting edge, very expensive de-aging technology that still had massive limitations, still created a bunch of complexity on set for the actors. It was a giant leap forward for sure, but nowhere near what we needed for that film. So this year, just five years later, Rodrigo's directing his first feature film for us, Pedro Paramore in Mexico. Using AI-powered tools, he was able to deliver this de-aging VFX to the screen, you know, for a fraction of what it cost on the Irishman. In fact, the entire budget of the film was about the VFX cost on the Irishman. So, same creator using new tools, new better tools to do something that would have been impossible to do just five years ago. That's incredibly exciting. So, our focus is simple. Find ways for AI to improve the member and the creator experience. Thanks, Ted. Our next question is from David Joyce of Seaport Research Partners. The question is, with so much content in your library, what can you do for discovery to help drive further engagement with the platform? Is there anything further structural you can do with the recommendation engine or is it going to require more marketing? Yeah, a fact that surprises many people is that even our most popular, most buzzy titles that you're hearing tons of conversation around, those still drive less than 1% of viewing. So that discovery and recommendations capabilities are really critical to unlocking all the value from the investments that Bella's team is making around the world. And we believe and we continually see this in test results quarter after quarter that there is more room to improve that discovery and recommendation experience and therefore provide more value for members and therefore find the biggest audiences for around the world for our titles. To that end, some examples of this last year, we began testing a new, simpler, more intuitive TV homepage. This is something that we hadn't made big structural changes to in over a decade. And we believe that that will significantly improve the discovery experience on Netflix. We've been polishing and improving that experience based on the input we got from members who used it. And we plan on rolling that out later this year. So that's very exciting and a pretty significant structural shift that we anticipate will move things forward significantly. But we're doing things at the other end of the spectrum too. So we're also building out like new capabilities. An example would be interactive search that's based on generative technologies. We expect that will improve that aspect of discovery for members. So there's many, many specific improvements that we've got in works. So a lot more to come into space and really, frankly, no foreseeable limit on those improvements in the years to come. Great. Thanks, Greg. Michael Morris from Guggenheim has our next question. It's actually about extra member accounts. How is adoption of extra member accounts trended since launch? Can you share how this offer has contributed to revenue growth today and whether you see it as additive to future growth? We see Extra Member as a part of our plans and pricing model. So it's an option that provides flexibility and choice for members. It allows them to tailor the Netflix offering to their needs. We know some members want to share Netflix with family or friends and Extra Member gives them an easy way to do that. It's a lower cost way to do that as well. We see good retention and engagement on that plan, which is really important to us and says it's a sort of healthy part of the offering. But while we love it from a member convenience perspective, responding directly to the question, Extra Member isn't a major driver for our business, and we expect it'll remain relatively small in the foreseeable future. Thanks, Greg. I just say to Greg's point, I agree with all that. It is, I think, part of the question. It is still growing, honestly, so it's healthy for all those reasons, but it's just not a big driver in the business. Thanks, Spencer, for clarifying. Justin Patterson from KeyBank with the next question. Alon, who leads our Netflix games business, spoke recently at the Games Developer Conference about making gaming more accessible and achieving mass market appeal. What types of games have resonated on Netflix so far, and where do you see opportunities to improve the user experience to drive even more engagement for games? Yep, we have learned quite a bit and made some decent progress since we launched games, but we continue to see this as a multi-year iterative journey, much like we've seen and you've seen from us when we launch a new content category or we launch a new country and we develop product market fit and improve that over time. You asked what games have worked for us so far. You can see much of the answer to that question embedded in the genres that we're going after and focusing on right now. So that starts with immersive narrative games based on our IP. Squid Game Unleashed is a really good example. We'll have an update for that game with the latest season of Squid Game that's coming. More recently, Thronglets, which is our Black Mirror-based Tamagotchi-style game that has a dark twist in the end, very consistent with Black Mirror. Another category that we're going after is mainstream established titles. This is Grand Theft Auto, which really worked for us, and you'll see us launch more titles like that in the future. There's also games for kids, you know, being able to give kids a game experience that's free of ads, it's free of any in-app purchases, you know, safe for parents with a subscription. We just announced Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig game, which is coming soon. So that's an example of that. And the fourth category, which I would say we don't have a lot of data points demonstrated in yet, but we're excited about, and we'll be delivering some to understand the space better, is socially engaging party games. Think about this as either an evolution of the family board game or an evolution of the game show on TV that becomes interactive in your living room. So lots of excitement there. And then you mentioned in terms of areas to improve, there's tons of areas to improve. Frankly, we can improve everything that we're doing from user experience and discovery and getting to play, but also just in having more compelling games. So that's a real top priority for us at this point. And maybe just a few comments with regard to how we think about investment and growth in this space. We've always said that we were in this to win. We want to invest enough to ensure that we are playing to win. But we also are coming knowing that we've got a lot to learn and we still have a lot to learn despite all that we've learned so far. We don't want to grow our investment too much until we iteratively develop high confidence that we know how to translate that investment into member value, like the increased retention we see when members play our games. So our investment by our scale is still relatively modest. It's a small fraction of our overall content budget. And as we continue to see incremental proof points, we'll ramp up that investment in a measured way. But we think this approach, the sort of measured growth and planned scarcity, actually yields a better business in the long-term. And the long-term opportunity is large. It's about 140 billion in consumer spend, ex-China, ex-Russia, not including ad revenue. We believe in our top-level strategic thesis, and we continue to learn into that executional capability to incrementally unlock that potential. Thanks, Greg. I'm actually going to bring us back to a question on the results because we do have a late-breaking question from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. Can you unpack the key drivers of the expected UCAN revenue growth reacceleration in Q2? Is it mainly pricing or are there other aspects like advertising or subscriber growth? Maybe Spencer, you want to take a stab at that one? Yeah, sure. So, you know, you saw in our report, our UCAN revenue growth was 9% year over year in Q1. That was deceleration from about 15% year over year in Q4. The deceleration is mostly due to pricing timing. So there's a little bit of a sequential quarter, tough comparison, because we also had the benefit of the NFL games and the advertising resulting from the NFL games in Q4, which also bumped it a bit. But think of it as we plan to reaccelerate again in Q2, and it's really getting the full quarter benefit year over year of pricing. And then also, you know, we are ads is still a much smaller part of our business than subscription, but ads continues to kind of grow through the year. Thanks, Spence. And I will now close this out with our last question, which comes from Alan Gould of Loop Capital. His question is, you've been guiding to $8 billion of free cash flow in 2025, and one of your goals is to deliver growing free cash flow. You have historically not spent a lot on acquisitions. Should we assume most of the growing free cash flow is redeployed into share buybacks? Yeah, thanks, Alan. So there's no change to our capital allocation policy. It's been consistent for years now. We prioritize profitable growth by reinvesting in the business. We maintain ample liquidity. Those are key for us, our top two priorities. And then we return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase beyond several billion dollars of minimum cash that we keep on the balance sheet, and then anything we use for first select M&A. So that's kind of a long wind up to the answer is yes, in the absence of any meaningful M&A, not MBA, any meaningful M&A, we would expect that our growing free cash flow will be redeployed to share a purchase. Excellent. Well, before we close, first, thank you all for joining us. I would like to take a moment to recognize and to thank Tim Haley. For after more than 27 years on our board of directors, he has elected to not stand for reelection. For all of those 27 years, Tim Haley has been on this journey with us. His counsel and leadership has been a really valued part of our success. I'd like to say a special thank you to Tim for his long service and his many contributions to the next board of directors. And let me say also as someone who's benefited greatly from our time with Tim and has been there with him for most of those years, that through so much change and so much growth, Tim has always offered sage advice and counsel and is an important part of the history of Netflix. Tim has helped shaped Netflix into the company that it is today. So many thanks to Tim and thank you very much for joining us.",

      "transcript": " Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2025 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wong, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters and CFO, Spence Newman. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. We'll take questions submitted by the analyst community, and we will begin with our results and our forecast. The first question comes from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. The question is, since the revenue increase in your forecast is primarily FX-driven, we're curious about the components of the constant currency increase. Is this due to a better underlying revenue growth or are there specific expenses that are coming in better like content amortization? I will take that one. Thanks, Steve. As you saw on the letter, we increased our full year revenue guidance to $44.8 to $45.2 billion. That's up from the prior guide of $43.5 to $44.5 billion. So up about a billion at the midpoint of the range and a tighter range. As you know, it primarily reflects the FX impact from the weakening dollar relative to most other currencies. But the good news is we're also seeing strength in our underlying business. We've got healthy member growth, and that even picked up nicely at the end of Q2, a bit more than we expected. And we think that'll carry through with our strong back half slate. So we're reflecting that in our latest forecast. And we're also seeing nice momentum in ad sales, still off a pretty small base, but good growth. And it's on pace to roughly double our revenue in the year. And it's a bit ahead of beginning of year expectations. So when we carry all that through to operating margin, our operating expenses are essentially unchanged, which is part of your question. So they're basically unchanged forecast to forecast. So we're largely flowing through the expected higher revenues to profit margins. So that's why our updated target full year reported margin is up a point from 29 to 30%. And that 50 basis point increase in FX neutral margin is really just that revenue lift from stronger membership growth and ads relative to prior forecast flowing through to margin. Thank you, Spence. We'll take our next question from Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities. Why is operating margin guidance for the full year only 30% after the upside in 2Q and a forecast of 31.5% for the third quarter? Is there a timing issue, FX issue, or is there a new level of spending that will continue beyond the back half of the year. We've also, you know, Q4 is typically a, and generally almost always is a heavier film slate. Sure. We'll talk about, I expect we'll talk about more of this on the call. We'll also be marketing to support that heavier slate and, and we're continuing to aggressively build out our ad sales infrastructure and capabilities through the, through the year. So all of that is to be expected. We can manage to, we manage to those margins. And even with that back half ramp and expenses, we expect operating margins to be up year over year in each quarter, including Q4. And as just noted, we expect to deliver strong full year margins as we just took up our our guide to, you know, 29 and a half percent FX neutral 30 percent reported. Great. Thanks, Spence. The next question comes from Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. How has your view of the consumer and the macro economy changed over the last 90 days? Similar to last quarter, we're carefully watching consumer sentiment in the broader economy. But at this point, there's really nothing significant to note in the metrics and the indicators that we get directly through the business. Those are retention that remains stable and industry leading. There have been no significant shifts in plan mix or plan take rate. And the price changes we've done since the last quarter have been in line with expectations. Engagement also remains healthy. So things all look stable from those indicators and big picture entertainment in general and Netflix specific have been historically pretty resilient and tougher economic times. We also think that we are an incredible entertainment value, you know, not only compared to traditional entertainment, but if you think about other streaming competitors, when we start at $7.99 in the United States and you think about all the entertainment you get, we have a belief and expectation that the demand for not only entertainment, but for us specifically will remain strong. Thanks, Greg. I think it's a nice follow up to this question. We'll be on advertising. So from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, can you share any data points around your upfront negotiations? Yep. As we noted in the letter, our U.S. upfront, it's nearly complete. We've closed the large majority of deals with the major agencies. Those results have generally been in line or slightly better than our targets and consistent with our goal to roughly double the ads business this year. And what are advertisers excited about? Growing scale is something we definitely hear. Also a highly attentive and engaged audience. So bigger audience, but also an audience that's more engaged relative to our peers. The rollout of our own ad tech stack, which helps deliver a bunch of features. And then our slate, which is generally amazing and includes a growing number of live events that advertisers are excited about. Great. Follow up question on advertising from Vikram Baird. How have advertisers in the US responded to the Netflix ad suite rollout since the April launch? What features and capabilities are attracting the most interest and how is the initial feedback in other regions outside of the U.S.? We've completed the rollout of our own ads tech stack, the Netflix Ad Suite, to all of our ad markets now, so we're fully on our own stack around the world at this point. That rollout was generally smooth across all countries. We see good performance metrics across all countries, and the early results are in line with our expectations. Now we're in this phase of learning and improving quickly based on the fact that being live everywhere means that you get a bunch of feedback about what we can do better, which is great. As we mentioned before, the most immediate benefit from this rollout is just making it easier for advertisers to buy on Netflix. We hear that benefit, that ease from direct feedback talking to advertisers. They tell us that it's easier. We see it in our overall sales performance. We've seen an increased programmatic buying. So all of these are consistent with what we were expecting both qualitatively and from a metrics perspective. We're also, I guess, worth noting that we're going to roll out additional demand sources like Yahoo. That'll further open up the market for us. Long-term being on our own stack, that improves the speed of our execution to deliver this pretty significant roadmap of features that we have in front of us. It's things like improved targeting and measurement. There's also leveraging advertiser and third-party data sources, which we definitely hear demand for as well. And it will ultimately allow us to improve the ad experience for our members, which is critically important. So that means better ads personalization. So the ads that I see are increasingly different from the ads that say Ted would see. And they're more relevant for each of us, which is good for us as users. And it's good for the brands. We're also going to be introducing interactivity in the second half of the year. So that's exciting. So that's all to say this is, you know, a pretty significant milestone for us. One we're super excited to get behind us because now we can shift into this steady release cycle where we're dropping new features all the time, both for advertisers and for members. And that's the development and release model that we have into the parts of the business. So it's fun to be able to get to that point. Thanks, Greg. I'll move us along now to a set of questions around content as well as engagement. This one comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. 1% engagement growth year over year suggests engagement is down year over year on an average per member basis. How do we reconcile that with engagement growing on a per-member household basis, if that's still accurate? Total view hours did grow a bit in the first half, 25, and that's despite a particularly back-half-weighted slate. But to your point on engagement on a per-member basis, we've mostly been focused for the last few years on measuring engagement on what we call an owner household basis. So this takes out the borrower effect. And we obviously think this is the best way to assess our engagement per member because it removes the tricky comparison impacts from paid sharing. So that metric per owner household engagement has been relatively steady over the past two and a half years throughout the rollout of paid sharing and admits increasing competition for TV time as more viewing moves to streaming and gets this on demand benefit. So we're glad to have held that normalized engagement level, but we clearly also want to increase it. And to that end, we're optimistic and expect that our engagement growth in the second half of this year will be better than and Wednesday in Stranger Things releasing in the coming months. You often say that no single title drives more than 1% of total viewing. So how do you think about the business currently as being quote, quote, hit boosted or hit driven? And are you confident that both original and licensed content momentum can continue in 2026? Yeah, I'll take that. And thank you, Doug. On the first part of your question, we're definitely riding this long-term trend of linear to streaming, and that has a natural adoption curve. But we can accelerate our growth with big hits. But as you said, each one of them, even in success, can drive about 1% of total viewing. So you need a lot more than just a big hit every once in a while. So to your point, it's not about the single hit. So what it is is about a steady drumbeat of shows and films and soon enough games that our members really love and continue to expect from us. So like by way of example, we had 44 individual shows nominated for Emmys this year. So that's what quality at scale looks like. We ended the quarter with a huge return to Squid Game. Thanks for acknowledging. Go into the second half with the return of Wednesday and Stranger Things, and a really strong sleight of supporting titles and favorites and new shows. This week, we had Eric Bana's Untamed. Next week, we have LeAnn Morgan's new comedy show, Leanne. Both look really great. And that's just to name a few. And the back half of the year also has perhaps the most anticipated slate of new movies that we've ever had. And that starts on the 25th with Happy Gilmore 2. Followed by, we have a new Knives Out film. We have new films from Noah Baumbach, from Guillermo del Toro, from Catherine Bigelow. And it does not stop there. It does roll right into 2026. And that's the second part of your question. And we're looking forward to movies like The Rip from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Shirley Stern, a new movie called Apex, which is a phenomenal action movie. Millie Bobby Brown is back in Anola Holmes 3. Recall that in 2023, Anola Holmes 2 was our biggest movie. So we're looking forward to that new sequel. And Greta Gerwig's Narnia is going to be phenomenal. And then on top of that, we talk about Return of Bridgerton, One Piece, Avatar, The Last Airbender, all three huge successes around the world. The Gentleman, Four Seasons, Point Break, I'm sorry, Running Point, sorry. Beef, which as you recall in 2023, won just about every award imaginable and was a gigantic success for us. It's back for a new season in 26. Three Body Problem, Love is Blind, Outer Banks. And not just from the US, from France, we have Lupin. From Spain, we have Berlin. We have a new season of 100 Years of Solitude from Columbia. So big hit returning shows and new series from each of our regions around the world. And the new stuff we've got coming up like Man on Fire, Reimagining of Little House on the Prairie, The Duffer Brothers from Stranger Things have a brand new show, The Burrows. We've got Human Vapor from Japan, Operation Saffron Cigar from India, Can This Love Be Translated from Korea? So again, popular programming, new and returning from all over the world in 2026. Unscripted shows like the reboot of Star Search. We got Into the Doll Universe with Wonka's Golden Ticket, which we're really excited about. And in our live, we've got a few surprises for you next year. But of course, we have our NFL Christmas Day double header that we're really thrilled about too. So we're really incredibly excited about the back half of this year and confident that it keeps rolling in 26. Thank you, Ted. We'll take the next question from Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners, who asks, are you concerned by the stagnation in your viewing share domestically? I think Rich is probably referring to the Nielsen gauge data. Do you need to spend more on programming or spend differently to materially move your viewing share higher? Yeah, thanks, Rich. Look, our goal continues to be to continue to grow our share over the long term. And over the past few years, you're right, we've been able to maintain our share even as we've worked through a growing number of TV-based streaming services, some free, some paid, and the impact of paid sharing that Greg mentioned earlier, as well as this, you know, 2025 slate that was more back half-weighted than we typically have in previous years. But over the long term, we tend to keep growing as the other 50% of TV viewing migrates from linear to streaming. And we'll do that by doing what we've always done, continuously improve the service. So keep in mind, since 2020, our content amort has grown more than 50%, you know, from under $11 billion to more than $16 billion that we expect to do this year. And over that same time period, we definitely had, we saw increased spending, but also increased engagement, increased revenue, increased profit, and increased profit margin. So that's our model in action. It is our objective to sustain healthy revenue growth, reinvest in the business to improve on all aspects of the service. And that includes growing content spend, strengthening and expanding the entertainment offering, and to drive that positive flywheel of growth by adding value to our members and all the while growing engagement, revenue and profit around the world. Great. Thank you, Ted. I'll move to Alan Gould from Loop Capital next. Can you provide more information on the TF1 partnership? Why did you choose to add TF1 in France as opposed to other broadcasters as your first partner? Why is now the right time to create such a partnership? Should we anticipate similar partnerships in other countries. Yeah, perhaps just start with the rationale for the partnership. You would think with that long list of amazing titles that Ted just rattled off, we would have enough to satisfy every person on the planet. But it turns out we actually consistently hear from our members that they want more. They want more variety, more breadth of content. So the fundamental purpose for this TF1 partnership is all about that goal of expanding our entertainment offering. How do we enhance the value we deliver to members? We want to provide more content, more variety, more quality. So just as you've seen us do with licensing and production, this is just another mechanism to expand that offering. And in this case, it's specifically about highly relevant local for local content in a country that has strong demand for that local content. This is an accelerated way to satisfy that need. Why now? Why was this time the right time? Well, we've invested a lot in a bunch of enabling capabilities that are either required or highly leveraged by this deal. You can think live ads, the new UI, among other things. And then why TF1 versus some other partner? Well, we know each other really well. We wanted our first partner to be in a big territory. We wanted to pick the leading local programmer. We wanted to be highly aligned in terms of the deal and the shape of the partnership and the values that we thought we could generate mutually by working together for our customers. And we both look at this as an opportunity to learn, to figure out how do we scale the local content that TF1 is producing to more customers in France. So we're looking forward to seeing what consumers think. You never really know until you get out there and get the real reactions. And then obviously we'll factor that into our plans going forward. Thanks, Greg. From Robert Fishman of Moffitt-Nathanson, with reports suggesting Apple is now in the driver's seat for F1 rights. Haha, unintended, I guess. Plus, UFC and MLB still looking for new deals and the NFL may be looking to come to market a year earlier. Can you share updated thoughts on how you are approaching sports rights for Netflix and where you draw the line on something that can move the needle? Well, thanks for that, Robert. Remember, sports are a subcomponent of our live strategy, but our live strategy goes beyond sports alone. Our live strategy and our sports strategy are unchanged. We remain focused on ownable, big breakthrough events because our audiences really love them. Anything we chase in the event space or in the sports space has got to make economic sense as well. We bring a lot to the table and the deals that we make have to reflect that. So live is a relatively small part of the total content spend. And we've got about 200 billion view hours. So it's a pretty small part of view hours as well right now. But that being said, not all view hours are equal. And what we've seen with live is has an outsized positive impacts around conversation, around acquisition, and we suspect around retention. And so right now, we're very excited where we sit. We're very excited with the existing strategy. We're excited about the Canelo-Crawford fight in September and the SAG awards and our weekly WWE matches and the NFL, of course, which is a great property. And we're happy to have Christmas Day doubleheader, which includes Dallas versus Washington and Detroit versus Minnesota. So today, our live events have all primarily been in the US, keep in mind. So over time, we're going to continue to invest and grow our live capabilities for events around the world in the years ahead. So we're excited, but the strategy is unchanged. Thanks, Ted. Good follow-up question on that one from Steve Cahal of Wells Fargo. What investments have you made to increase your capabilities in producing live events? What have you been able to do in-house in 2025 that you couldn't do last year? And how long will it take before you have the capability to produce large-scale events like NFL games? Yeah, thanks, Steve. I'd say, remember, when we started original scriptive programming, we had zero production capability. House of Cards was, in fact, thinking about our first three years of original programming, all of those shows were produced by others. Three years later, we produced Stranger Things in-house. Today, we still have shows that are produced by others. You have to go three years later, we produce Stranger Things in-house. Today, we still have shows that are produced by others. Universal, 20th Television, which is Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Television. There's lots of available infrastructure to produce TV, and that is true of live events and sports as well. When we do more and more, we may choose to bring some of that in-house. We've already produced a few, and we're just as likely to continue to use partners with existing production infrastructure and work to make sure that those productions are bespoke and they feel like they could only be on Netflix. So you shouldn't think about the mix of partnerships and self-producing as a as we think about it as a scaling tool, not backfilling some lack of ability in some area of the company. So and I should note, by example, CBS is a phenomenal partner producing NFL games with us, and we're thrilled to work with them again this year on Christmas Day. Maybe take this opportunity just to make some commentary on the general capability we've been building with Live. You know, when we start something new, we pretty much expect that we're not going to be brilliant at it at the beginning. What? Yeah, that's true, unfortunately. We don't have any real reason to believe that. But we don't let that stop us from kicking off initiatives that we believe have a strong strategic rationale, even though we know we need to develop that capability. And of course, our job is to get out there and learn by doing and get world class as quickly as we possibly can. And if you look at our current capabilities around live, we are in just a completely different place today compared to when we first started. As a good example that just happened last Friday, we had our first concurrent pair of live events. We had Taylor versus Serrano globally delivered alongside WWE SmackDown, which was delivered at XUS, both events at scale and delivered with extremely high quality. So it's great progress we've seen and we've got a great roadmap of features ahead of us to continue to enhance those experiences for folks. Thank you both. Last question on the content side or the topic of content comes from Ben Swinburne and Morgan Stanley. What are the learnings from the success of K-pop Demon Hunters? More animated musicals with fictional bands, perhaps, question mark. Ben, that is a question from a man who probably has that movie playing on repeat in their home, if I'm guessing correctly. K-pop Demon Hunter is a phenomenal success out of the gate. One of the things that I'm really proud of the team over is original animation, not sequel, not live action remake. Original animation feature is very tough and has been struggling for years. And I think the fact that our biggest hits now, Leo, Sea Beast, and now K-Pop Demon Hunters, are original animation. So we're super thrilled about that. The mix of music and pop culture, getting it right matters. The storytelling matters. The innovation in animation itself matters. And the fact that people are in love with this film and the love with the music from this film, that'll keep it going for a long time. So we're really thrilled. And now the next beat is where does it go from here? So, you know, we put in the letter how just how successful the music has been and continues to be. And we think that'll drive fandom for this fictional K-pop bands that we have. But more importantly, for the song Golden and for the song Soda Pop. These are enormous hits and they all came from a film that's available only on Netflix. So we're really excited that we can pierce the culture with original animated features considering that folks have been poking us on it. Let's do it again later in the year within your Your Dreams, right, Ted? Absolutely. In Your Dreams is another very funny one and also completely original. Great. I'll move us on now to a few questions on plans as well as product. So from Michael Morris of Guggenheim, he asks, Netflix continues to broaden content genres, notably with live sports and the recently announced TF1 partnership. Is there a path to additional tiers of service based on types of content available or will Netflix always make all content available at the ad free slash ad supported price points? I've learned to never say never. So I would say we remain open to evolving our consumer facing model. I think I think we've got a few important principles that we're carrying with us that I don't see changing significantly. One is we want to provide members choice. So how do we have a different set of plans, a different price points, different features that allows folks to opt into what is the right Netflix for them? Also, how do we provide good accessibility to new members around the world we want to grow? And that means making sure that we've got accessible price points. And then finally, the plans we offer, they have to ensure that we're having reasonable returns to the business based on the entertainment value that we delivered and we're hoping to grow those. And so those returns would grow as well. Now, obviously, the reason to do that is we can continue to reinvest in adding more entertainment and building a better experience. And maybe one other thought too, is there is a component of complexity and choice stacks that we have to consider and how we think about our offering is structured. So having said all that though, I think we believe that the bundle is a great value for members. It allows members around the world to access a wide range of entertainment in a very easy way at a very reasonable price. So I would expect that that will remain an important feature of our offering for the foreseeable future. A lot of value and simplicity. Yeah. Great. From Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners, help us understand why your new UI slash UX is so important as you expand live content. Beyond live, can you provide some color on what metrics have improved since the launch of the new UI, such as speed of users finding a title and change in failed sessions? Yeah, as we said previously, it's really hard for a new UI to immediately compete, be better than the UI that we've had for the past 10 years that's been iteratively evolved and improved. But now that we've actually rolled out this new UI to the first large wave of TV devices, we're actually seeing performance that's better than what we saw in our pre-launch testing. To some degree, that's expected because we made some improvements based on the results of that testing phase. So it's exciting to see that those delivered actual better results. But the rate of that change actually gives us increased confidence that this new experience will drive better performance by the variety of metrics we look at, some of which include the ones that Rich is mentioning in relatively short order. And then maybe just a point on why do we build this and launch this new experience in the first place? Why was this so important? Bluntly, the previous experience was designed for the Netflix of 10 years ago, and the business has evolved considerably since then. We got a wider breadth of entertainment options. We got TV and film, more of those, of course, from around the world, but now also games and live events. And if you think about the discovery experience that's best suited for these new content types, it's inherently different. Helping our members understand that there's a really good reason for them to launch Netflix and tune in at 7 p.m. on a Friday night versus just showing up whenever they were free and wanted to be entertained, that's a totally different job and we really need a different user interface to do that job well. Add to that, we saw the opportunity to leverage newer technologies like real-time recommendations that respond dynamically to what you need from us in that specific moment. So the Netflix you get on a Tuesday night is different from the Netflix you get on a Sunday afternoon. But all of those rationales together and what we're seeing in terms of the performance so far, we're very confident that we've got a much better and their content exclusively to Netflix? How big could this opportunity be? Thanks, Steve. Look, we want to be in business with the best creatives on the planet, regardless of where they come from. Some of them are here in Hollywood. Others are in Korea. Some are in India. And some are creators that distribute only on social media platforms. And most of them have not yet been discovered. So for those creators doing great work, we have phenomenal distribution, desirable monetization, brilliant discovery in our UI, and a hungry audience waiting to be entertained. So Steve, you recently, I think I listened to you on a podcast where you talked about our business model and I believe on this very topic. And we largely agree with you and believe that working with a wide set of content creators makes a lot of sense for us. And as you said, if I'm remembering it right, not everything on YouTube will fit on Netflix. And we couldn't agree with that more. But there are some creators on YouTube like Miss Rachel that are a great fit. If you saw in the engagement report, she said 53 million views in the first half of 2025 on Netflix. So she clearly works on Netflix. And we're really excited about the Sidemen and Pop the Balloon and a wide variety of creators and video podcasters that might be a good fit for us. And particularly if they're doing great work and looking for different ways to connect with audiences. And maybe broadening this out for a second and taking that question to look at sort of all of the competitors that we face for a share of TV time. We've always said that the market for entertainment is very large and we face competition from all kinds of directions. So whether it's linear or streamers or video games or social media, it's also a very dynamic competitive market as we and all of our competitors seek to provide better and better options for consumers. And one of those changes, one of those vectors of dynamicism has been that sort of steady, inevitable shift to streaming and on-demand as more services move to deliver their content in a way that we all know consumers want. That creates increasing competitive pressure for us that we've got to respond to. We also see free services as a form of strong competition. Free is very powerful from a consumer perspective. So it's not surprising that some free services are growing in engagement. But I think Ted said it well earlier in the call, not all hours are created equal. And we have a different profit model from other services, a strong profit model. So we're going to compete to win more moments of truth for sure, but especially compete to win those most profitable moments. And back to your specific question, it's worth remembering there's about 80% of total TV view share that neither Netflix or YouTube are winning right now. We think that represents a huge opportunity for which we are competing aggressively and we aim to grow our share. The vast majority of our money and attention is focused on that 80%. Thank you. Next question from Justin doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of AI. We're seeing the benefits of cheaper. They're AI powered creator tools. So this is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot planning work, and certainly visual effects. It used to be that only big budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging. Remember last quarter we talked about Pedro Paramo. Well, that's just no longer the case. And this year, we had LA Tonata is a very big hit show for us from Argentina. And in that production, we leveraged virtual production and AI-powered VFX. And there was a shot in the show that the creators wanted to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires. So our iLine team partnered with their creative team using AI-powered tools. They were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed. And in fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with traditional VFX tools and workflows. And also the cost of it just wouldn't have been feasible for a show in that budget. So that sequence actually is the very first GEN.AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film. So the creators were thrilled with the result. We were thrilled with the result. And more importantly, the audience was thrilled with the result. So I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen. And that is endlessly exciting. And maybe to cover a few of the other areas, you know, the member experience is a place where we feel like there's tons of opportunity to leverage these new generative technologies to improve the experience. We've been in the personalization and recommendation business for two decades, but yet we see a tremendous room and opportunity to make it even better by leveraging some of the more newer generative techniques. We're also rolling out, have piloted right now a conversational experience that allows our members to basically have a sort of natural language discussion with our user interface saying, you know, I want to watch a film from the 80s that's, you know, a dark psychological thriller, get some results back, maybe iterate through those in a way that you just couldn't have done in our previous experiences. So that's super exciting. And, you know, we see that all of the work that we do there essentially is a force multiplier to that large content investment that we're making. If we do a better job there, that means every dollar that we spend means more value back to our members by connecting them with the titles that they're truly going to love. Advertising is another really great area. It's a high hurdle to create a brand-forward spot in a creative universe of one of the titles that we're currently carrying, but it's very compelling for both watchers and for those brands. We think these generative techniques can decrease that hurdle iteratively over time and enable us to do that in more and more spots. There's a bunch of places where we think we've got an advantage in terms of data and scale where we can leverage these new generative techniques to deliver just more benefits for our members and for our creative community. Yeah. If you don't mind me coming back for one second, I just rolled off Eyeline as if everyone knows what Eyeline is. I probably should clarify that Eyeline is our production innovation group inside of our VFX house at Scanline. And they're doing a lot of this work with our creators. So I just realized that I just threw that out there as if everyone knew. Thanks for clarifying, Ted. Let's see. Our next question comes from Brian Pitts of BMO Capital Markets. With your evolving gaming ambitions, including partnerships with Grand Theft Auto and the recently announced Roblox agreement. Can you talk to near-term monetization opportunities within gaming? Sure. We look at the near-term monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we've looked at other new content categories. You can think in scripted or film or on and on. And that's essentially if we deliver more value in our offering, we get increased user acquisition, we get increased retention, we get increased willingness to pay. So it drives all of the core fundamentals of our business. We've seen those positive effects, albeit in a small way relative to the size of our overall business when it comes to members playing games on the service. We already have those positive proof points. And we're going to ramp our investment in this area, which is currently quite small compared to our overall content investment, as we ramp the size of those positive effects. So we want to remain disciplined in not investing too far ahead of demonstrating that we know how to translate that investment into value for our members. We've seen good progress, as you note, with licensed games like GTA. We've seen good progress with games we developed like Squid Game Unleashed. So you'll see more from us in both of those categories, as well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think that we're either in a unique or differential position to deliver. So we're super excited to roll those out over the next year. And then we remain open to the core question, remain open evolving our monetization model, but we have got to get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. So we're going to do that work first. And it's probably worth restating the TAM for this market is very, very large. We remain convicted about our strategic opportunity and excited to make more progress. Thanks, Greg. We'll take our last question from Jessica Reif-Ehrlich of Bank of America Securities. Given your healthy balance sheet and what appears to be a coming wave of M&A and media globally, are there certain types of assets that would strengthen your moat, i.e. what is your view of owning successful IP or studio assets as they come to market? I'll take that one, Spencer. Thanks, Jessica. We agree, continued consolidation of studio and network assets is likely, but at least with respect to consolidation within legacy media, we don't think it materially changes the competitive landscape. As you also know, we've historically been more builders than buyers and we continue to see big runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. You heard a lot of that today. So we look at a lot of things. We apply a framework or a lens to those opportunities when we look at, you know, is it a big opportunity? Does it strengthen our entertainment offerings? Does it strengthen our capabilities? Does it accelerate our strategy? And we look at all of that relative to the opportunity cost of distraction or other alternatives. You know, we've been pretty clear in the past that we also have no interest in owning legacy media networks. So that also kind of reduces the funnel for us. But in general, we believe we can and will be choosy. We've got a great business. We're predominantly focused on growing that organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into that growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share or purchase. And I think you'll see us continue on that path. Great. Thanks, Spence. And that will wrap up our Q2 earnings call. So we thank you all for taking the time to join us and we look forward to seeing you all next quarter. Thank you.",

      "transcript": " Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2025 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wong, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters and CFO, Spence Newman. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. We'll now take questions submitted by the analyst community and we will start with our results and outlook. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, who asks, as you begin to wrap up 2025 and look to 2026, can you talk broadly about the health of the business and how you would frame the opportunity ahead? Yeah, we think the business is very healthy. We feel good about our progress on our key initiatives. We've got also a lot of opportunity ahead of us, but we got a lot of work we need to do to accomplish and fully realize those opportunities. So what's working? We had a good Q3. We had revenue in line with expectations. Our operating income would have exceeded our forecast absent the Brazilian tax matter. We're also seeing good progress against our key priorities. So engagement remains healthy. We achieved record share at TV time in Q3 in both the U.S. and the U.K. We recorded our best ad sales quarter ever. We're now on track to more than double ad revenue this year. We're continuing to build out both live offerings and games as the emerging capabilities. On live side. We saw Canelo Crawford. That was the most viewed men's championship fight this century. We recently announced the ability to play Netflix games on TV with friends and family playing together at home using just that TV and the phone is the game controller. So this progress in these areas is indicative of how we think we can best compete and grow the business over the long term. We focus on a few key areas that we think matter the most. And then we work hard to deliver continuous improvement in those areas. It sounds super simple, but building a real at scale global streaming business is hard because you got to combine great tech product and great content from all around the world. And we believe we can continue to improve in both those areas. But Ted, maybe you want to comment on that? Yeah, I would just say, you know, looking ahead, we continue to have a massive opportunity since we're only about 7% of the addressable market in terms of consumer spending and only about 10% of time spent on TV in our biggest market. So enormous room for profitable growth in the core business. And this is a very exciting time in terms of a lot of innovation, a lot of competition, but that's been true for the last 25 years. And one thing as a company, we've always embraced change. We thrive on competition, you know, pushes us to improve the service even faster for our members. You know, back at the beginning in the early DVD days even, and now in streaming and global streaming of original content, we compete with the biggest players in the world, tech and media. And as you see, we keep growing engagement, revenue and profit. So today we're an entertainment company. We program for an audience that's approaching a billion people around the world. We're producing series and films for local audiences in multiple markets. Many of those films and series resonate around the world. And a really great example of that, I think, is this summer's K-pop Demon Hunters. Obviously a smash hit, but it's also emblematic of exactly what we're trying to do every day. In fact, feature animation is an example of that continuously improving the core. We've been grinding away at original feature animation for a few years now and K-Pop Demon Hunters is our most popular film ever. And again, it proves our ability to create breakthrough hits and move the culture. Today we announced Mattel and Hasbro have been named the global co-master toy licensees for K-Pop Demon Hunter. This is a rare, maybe unprecedented partnership for them. And we're going to need them both to help meet the massive demand for fans to get closer to their characters off screen every day. We're here to entertain the world, and we're delivering tremendous value to our members every day. When you have a hit the size of K-pop Demon Hunters, it stirs the imagination of how big we could take this. And as long as we keep improving on the core business every day. So we feel great about the business. And as Greg said, we are as energized as ever. Thank you, Ted and Greg. Our next question comes from Steve Cahull of Wells Fargo. Can you please provide more color on the nature of the tax expense and why it fell above the operating line? Sure, Spencer. I'll take that one. Greg and Ted were on a roll, but I think I will take the short straw for this one. I'll spend a minute on it because this Brazilian tax matter, it's a bit complicated. I want to be sure we're being really clear about what it is and what it isn't. It's not an income tax. It's a cost of doing business in Brazil. It's a gross tax on outbound payments. And it's called the Contribution for Intervention in Economic Domains. So it's a bit of a mouthful. It involves a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to companies outside of Brazil. It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming. So we assume other companies will be impacted by this. In our case, Netflix Brazil pays Netflix US for services that enable Netflix Brazil to offer subscriptions to our Brazilian customers. And we actually received a favorable ruling from a lower court back in 2022 that concluded we were not subject to this tax, which is why we believe we couldn't accrue this previously. The legal issue in question relates to the scope of the transactions covered by the tax, and in particular whether the tax applies to service payments that don't involve a transfer of technology. We flagged this as a potential exposure in our prior 10Ks and 10Qs dating back to our 2023 10K. And then in August of this year, the Brazil Supreme Court reached a 7-4 decision against an unrelated company ruling that the tax applies to a wider range of transactions than we thought was legally permissible. In particular, that it applies even to service payments that don't involve a transfer of technology. So given that court's ruling, that's caused us to reevaluate the likelihood of prevailing, and we now deem the loss to be probable. And that's why we recorded the expense in Q3. And again, it's not an income tax, and that's why we recorded the expenses as a component of our cost of revenues. And as we said in the letter, the expense we booked in this quarter, it covers the periods from 2022 through Q3 of 2025. Of the amount we booked in cost of revenues this quarter, just about 20% of it is for the year 2025 with the remainder related to those 2022 to 2024 periods. So, look, I know that was a lot. There's just two really important takeaways that I want to leave you with. The first is that the contribution for the contribution for intervention and economic domain, it's a unique tax. It is a mouthful. No other tax looks or behaves like this in any other major country in which we operate. And secondly, absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast. And we don't expect this matter to have a material impact on our results going forward. Great. Thanks, Spence. I'll move on to the next question, which comes from Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. Do you have any early views on revenue and operating income growth for 2026? The objectives are unchanged. We look to sustain healthy revenue growth, to expand margins and increase your cash flow. Now we did last year on our Q3 call, we did issue full year guidance, but that was in advance of sunsetting membership reporting. So it was a pretty unique timing giving that upcoming change in reporting for 26. Again, we'll issue the full year 26 guide as we more typically would on our next call in January. Thanks, Spence. I'll move us along to a few questions we've received on the topic of advertising. The first one comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Given your comment of doubling upfront commitments in the earnings letter, should we interpret this to mean that a full year 2026 advertising could also double? Well, start by just saying it's exciting to see our progress in 2025, more than doubling our ads revenue there. While, of course, it stole off a small base relative to the size of our subscription revenue. But we feel like we've established the fundamentals of the business now. We've proven we know how to scale. We see plenty of room for growth ahead. And what's making up that growth right now, as you mentioned, we more than doubled our U.S. upfront commitments that lands partly in 25 and partly in 26, which I think you're alluding to here. Perhaps even more importantly, though, we're seeing even higher rates of growth and programmatic. And that's more important because we believe that's going to be an increasing part of that incremental revenue contribution going forward. What are driving those results? Advertisers are excited about our growing scale. We've got a highly attentive and engaged audience. The rollout of our ad tech stack means we've got more formats, we've got more measurement, we've got more ways to buy. And of course, our slate is a critical and important source of competitive differentiation. So while I'll refrain from offering any 2026 guidance, I would say we are feeling good about our growth trajectory. Thanks, Greg. A follow up on that one from Vikram Kesava Botla of Baird. Your offering to advertisers has evolved significantly in 2025, including the launch of the ad suite and the integrations with additional demand sources. As we look into next year, what are some of the key priorities for the advertising business? Yeah, consistent with the last comment and answer, we made considerable progress in building out our general capabilities in the ad space. So if you use our beloved crawl, walk, run model, we're now squarely in that walking phase. The rollout of the ad suite, our own ad suite has been great because it means we're just continuing to learn and improve the stack based on client feedback. So we've got a really fast iteration loop going there that we're excited about. Key priorities and focus for us is making it easier for advertisers to buy on our service. We want to increase the diversity of advertisers we have. That's a key direction of growth for us that enables that revenue growth. We're adding more demand sources like Amazon, DSP, AJA in Japan. We're improving our own ad sales and go-to-market capabilities. We're also iterating on ad formats. Later this quarter, we'll be introducing ad interactivity. Taking that into 2026, you're going to see us continue to develop along some of those lines. So more ways to buy, more data for targeting and media planning capabilities globally, more modular interactive ad formats with enhanced AI capabilities, and more measurement functionality in all of our markets. And then in 2027, we get to pivot to make more focused investments in data capabilities, such as ML-based optimization, advanced measurement, advanced targeting. So I would say, you know, we're getting, we've got our legs underneath us. We're, you know, we're making a good pace, but we've got a lot ahead of us to go do. And quite frankly, we expect we're going to be able to move more quickly than other streamers as we leverage pre-existing tech and data science assets and expertise. Thanks, Rick. And to round out our last question on advertising, this one comes from Dan Salmon of New Street Research. Are fill rates improving in line with your expectations as the Netflix ad suite and new demand partnerships scale up. Now, we focus on overall revenue is the most important metric we're seeking to optimize. But having said that, fill rates have improved and we believe they're going to continue to improve as we continue to develop our go-to-market capabilities, more measurement, more targeting. Thanks, Greg. And now move us along to the topic of content and engagement. A lot of questions there. We'll begin first with Steve Cahal of Wells Fargo. Are you seeing a pickup and engagement like you've expected? Yes. Total view hours grew a bit faster in Q3 25 than in the first half of 25. In fact, in Q3, we achieved our highest quarterly view share ever in the United States at 8.6% and then the UK at 9.4% according to Nielsen and Barb respectively. These are just two countries that we've got really good measurements on that share. We also believe we're going to continue to see steady growth in view hours over time. We grow engagement by expanding our programming and the range of our offering. This is a critical and very proven dimension of growth for us. But we're also seeing that certain engagement delivers outsized and different value. And we saw pretty good examples of this in Q3. You got the Canelo Crawford fight, most viewed men's championship boxing match this century. You got K-pop Demon Hunters, our biggest film ever, huge impact on the cultural zeitgeist. Both are great examples and they're also from really different parts of our programming spectrum of this punctuated value. Now, we believe we've got a better understanding of the streaming business than any of our competitors, but we're also continuing to learn and we're in the process of really building a better understanding of how these particular moments deliver differential value to our members and the business. Yeah, I mean, just to add here, Steve, we're going to continue to benefit long term from the trend, just some folks moving from linear from linear viewing to streaming that has a kind of a natural adoption curve. But I also look for and we have an incredible slate in Q4, and we're really excited to follow that up in 2026. But it's not about any one single title in Q4 or next year. You know, as you know, even our largest titles and the biggest success generally drives less than 1% of our total viewing. So it's really about having a steady drum beat of shows and films that our members love. That's what drives continued steady growth and engagement over time. And we gave a lot of detail about our Q4 coming up in the letter, including an incredible slate of film and the wild ride finale of Stranger Things. But I wanted to give you a little bit of color in 26. Maybe this is a longer answer than you were bargaining for Steve But we're really particularly excited about a few things that coming up next year Like the return of some of our biggest and most loved shows like Bridgerton beef Emily in Paris One Piece Outer Banks Virgin River The Gentleman Avatar The Last Airbender Running Point Ginny, Lupin, all coming back for new seasons in 26. We've got this amazing slate of films with, you know, a big event film from Greta Gerwig with Narnia. Here Comes the Flood starring Denzel Washington. Ben Affleck is directing this great movie for us called Animals. Apex from Charlize Theron, an incredible action movie. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are on screen together and starring in The Rip. A couple of great rom-coms, Office Romance with Jennifer Lopez, People We Meet on Vacation. Our French team has got an incredible epic film, Quasimodo, coming up. And Peaky Blinders fans are going to freak out for the Peaky Blinders movie, The Immortal Man with Killian Murphy. It's really great and lots and lots of brand new series work coming going on this year and coming out in 26. Golf with Will Ferrell, Little House on the Prairie, Man on Fire. We have new series from the Duffer Brothers, amazing slate of K-dramas. That's just to name a few, but in other words, we've got a pretty great 26 coming up after this pretty phenomenal Q4. Thanks, Ted. Dan Kernos from Benchmark Company has a question about our Spotify partnership. How should we think about the recent deal with Spotify? How aggressively will you build out this podcast category? And so this deal is a video co-exclusive partnership with Spotify that secures a curated selection of their top podcasts to help us provide even more entertainment options for our members when they're looking for a pop culture or lifestyle or sports or true crime. And we get to deliver to them wherever and however they want to watch. And we're going to build into this category like we do with our other categories based on demand signals that we get from our members. And we see this as really the opportunity to integrate high quality video podcasts that broadens the Netflix offering beyond all the incredible films and series that Ted just mentioned, beyond the live events that we are building, stand-up specials and games. And we hope that, you know, that ultimately reinforces our value as the most important service for entertainment needs. Thanks, Greg. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman of Moffat Nathanson, following the strong theatrical performance of K-pop Demon Hunters, can you share your updated perspective on monetizing some of your content in the theatrical window on an is to give our members exclusive first-run movies on Netflix. We occasionally release certain films and theaters for our fans, like we did with K-Pop Demon Hunters, or as part of our launch strategy, publicity, marketing, qualification, all those things, and we'll continue to do that. We believe that this film, K-Pop Demon Hunters, actually worked because it was released on Netflix first. Look, we had a film that people fell in love with, that's first and foremost, but not in a huge way on the first day or even the first weekend. In fact, it was the super fans who watched the movie and repeat watched the movie that drove the recommendation engine, that got it in front of more super fans who also fell in love with the movie. So that ease and value that allowed folks to repeat view it, the ubiquity of distribution, which took all the guesswork out of how to watch it when you did finally see it show up in your social media feed, all of this contributed to K-pop demon hunters blowing up all over the world. And I would argue in a way that it couldn't happen anywhere else. If anything, this actually reinforces our strategy because being on Netflix gave the film a chance to build momentum and it allowed fans to learn the songs and to watch it over and over again and to make their own posts and their own dances around K-pop Demon Hunter. Now for some films, seeing it together and singing out loud is super fun and it's a differentiated experience and we were able to do that with the K-pop Demon Hunter sing-alongs eight weeks after the film premiered on Netflix. And we did have a good weekend. But we, you know, we created a great night out and we're going to do it again on Halloween weekend. And this time, every major theater chain is on for the ride. We also adding a few international markets. So it's been really fun to see this film and to see our ability to break through pop culture on par with some of the biggest theatrical films ever. And it's even better that it's with an original animated feature because it's so hard to do. Great. We now have a question on our live events from Vikram Kesebabotla of Baird. What were your observations from the Canelo versus Crawford fight in September? Are these types of live events from Vikram Kesebabotla of Baird. What were your observations from the Canelo versus Crawford fight in September? How are these types of live events impacting engagement, acquisition, and retention on the platform? Yeah, well, like Greg said earlier, the Canelo-Crawford fight was the most viewed men's championship fight of the century. It had over 41 million live plus one viewers. It was in the top 10 in 91 countries and it was a great fight. So we believe these big events that attract mass audiences are kind of differentially valuable for our members. It's a kind of urgent viewing that our members love and value. So these events typically have outsized positives for conversation and for acquisition. And we strongly suspect retention. Um, however, you know, we've said earlier, live is only a small portion of our content span and it's a very small portion of our 200 billion hours viewed. So it's a, you know, it's relatively small still, but hugely outsized impact. Uh, and we, you know, we like we've seen with other titles. This has had that kind of positive impact on acquisition. It's a little too early to say for sure and retention, but so far it looks a lot like the Jake Paul, Mike Tyson performance. And we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity in live. So, you know, upcoming, we've got Jake Paul versus Tank Davis from Miami, November 14th. And we really are trying to grow our capabilities outside of the U.S. as well, which we'll see next year with the World Baseball Classic from Japan. Thanks, Ted. And that's a good segue to our next question, which is the quarterly question about sports for us. This is from Robert Fishman of Moffitt Nathanson. Since last earnings, we've seen several sports rights deals, including Apple F1, Paramount, UFC, et cetera, et cetera. While we still await an official MLB update, can you help us think about the importance of global sports rights versus local rights to Netflix? And do the sports rights you look to acquire need to materially accelerate your advertising growth? So as for local versus global, it's just a scale question. Local cost versus the size of the local audience. So no real change in the approach. You know, we're focused on big live events, which sports are a subcomponent of the live strategy. We said before, we're not currently focused on the big season packages. In terms of global versus local, also we think about it just like series, it varies. Some like the Canela Crawford fight had big global appeal. We think World Baseball Classic in Japan was actually built and designed and budgeted for a specific geography. As far as advertising is concerned, the number one important thing we have to do is thrill our audiences. The revenue from advertising or subscription is the reward for thrilling the audience. So we have to stay disciplined on that approach. But for upcoming live events that we're excited about, I mentioned Jake Paul versus Tank. That's November 14th. We have our doubleheader NFL Christmas Day games with Dallas versus Washington, Detroit versus Minnesota. Skyscraper Live is going to be wild. The SAG Awards. We've got WWE every week. I mentioned the World Baseball Classic in Japan in 2026. And in 2027 and 31, we've got FIFA's Women's World Cup as well. So we're pretty excited about the slate and there's going to be a lot more that will come in between. Thanks, Ted. We'll take our next Rich, recently opened Netflix and were prompted with a 4k upgrade screen. Is this a typical promotion or are you selectively testing free trials? Yes, we test and productize a variety of offers that we think help members understand and sometimes try a feature or benefit that we think they might enjoy. So if you got a 4k TV as Rich does, you might get a notice from us and say, do you want to try watching, let's say, Skyscraper Live that Ted mentioned, somebody free climbing Taipei 101 in 4K and decide if that's a good option for you. But ultimately, we want a range of plans, we want a range of features, different price points, and then we want to help members choose the right plan for themselves. We think that yields a better member satisfaction, it yields better engagement and retention and a better long-term business. Thanks, Greg. We've gotten a series of questions on M&A on that topic today, not surprising given the announcement from our friends at Warner Brothers Discovery. So we'll take this next question from Jessica Reif-Ehrlich of Bank of America. Do you see potential industry consolidation reshaping the competitive landscape? Do you see that as an opportunity or a threat? What implications might that have for Netflix's content strategy and differentiation? Thanks, Jessica. Look, we'll take it in two parts. First, the opportunity. It's true that historically we've been more builders than buyers. And we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must have for us to meet the goals that we have for the business. But as we wrote in the letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them and we look at all of them and we apply the same framework and lens that we look at when we look to invest in a bill. Is it a big opportunity? First question. Second, if it's IP, does it strengthen our entertainment offering? Is there additional value in ownership? Does it strengthen our existing capabilities somehow? Does it accelerate our existing strategy? By the way, and you look at all these things relative to the price, relative to the opportunity cost, and relative to other alternatives. We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there. But in general, we believe that we can be, and we will be, choosy. We have a great business. We're predominantly focused on growing organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into the growth, and returning access cash flow to shareholders through our to share repurchase. Greg, do you want to add there on? Yeah, maybe I'll try and speak to that second part of this, the threat part of the question. We've always faced significant competition. We still face it today. This is an incredibly competitive entertainment environment. We've also seen a lot of industry consolidation over the years. Think about Disney Fox and Amazon picking up MGM. Of course, Time Warner and AT&T and then Discovery and Warner. But, you know, none of those mergers were a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And we have seen also a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change, in and of itself at least, our view on the competitive landscape. And we don't think it changes the substance of the challenge that our competitors face. Specifically, the range of activities that we and our competitors have to get great at has never been assembled in a single company before. Think about producing film and TV shows across multiple genres and multiple languages in dozens of countries around the world. Trying to figure out how to incorporate the latest technology, including AI and gen AI. We're trying to figure out how we build better product experiences that can serve consumers better around the world. How about customer acquisition and retention? How do we optimize global payments? How do we optimize global partnerships? There is so much. And we want to get better at all those things. Our competitors are seeking to get better at all those things, of course, as well. But you have to do that by the hard work of developing those capabilities in the trenches day to day. You don't get there simply by buying another company that is also still developing those same capabilities. So maybe I'll just end by reiterating what Ted said, which is it's our responsibility to look at every significant opportunity. We do that. We've got a clear framework to evaluate those opportunities and we'll do whatever we think is best to grow the business. Great. Thank you. David Joyce from Seaport Research Partners has a slightly different angle on the M&A question. Should potential industry consolidation with embedded studio and streaming assets, could that lead to less third-party content accessibility for Netflix? Thanks, David. Look, original titles are the big business driver for us. That's why we got into this more than 10 years ago. And it's why we continue to grow and expand the original content investment across new genres, new content forms, and multiple geographies. So we're happy to license titles from industry suppliers to complement our offering. But it's worth noting that we've always seen these kind of ebbs and flows from third party content in terms of access to it. Our competitors are also our suppliers. So they change their mind sometimes about selling to competitors. So we've been dealing with that since the beginning of streaming. But as we sit here today, we're not dependent on any single supplier. No single supplier represents more than a small minority of our total view hours. And more importantly, I think, is that we've proven time and time again that licensing to Netflix is the best way to build audience, build revenue, and create value for your IP. Whether it's Suits or Peaky Blinders or Breaking Bad, you know, we played a very positive role in the life cycle of other folks' IP, and we suspect that dynamic will continue. Great. We now have a question from Justin Patterson of KeyBank. Netflix recently launched party games that are playable on the TV. How do you think gaming could change the time members spend with Netflix each day? Well, games are clearly a form of entertainment consumers care about in terms of the time they spend, which you noted, as well as the money they spend. That's approximately $140 billion opportunity consumer spend, ex-China, ex-Russia. That doesn't even include the ad revenue, which, of course, is linked to the time and engagement. We've mostly talked so far about our work in this space as games, because that's an easy shorthand. But we see this initiative as more about interactivity broadly. And how does interactivity become complementary to linear storytelling? How is it able to unlock whole new entertainment experiences? For example, real-time voting will be our first live interactive feature. We're currently testing it on Dinner Time Live with David Chang. It's going to roll out more broadly, starting with Star Search in January. And we expect to provide other interactive features to deepen engagement with live events as we go in the future. And then when it comes to actual games, we've been building a ton of foundations for the last few years. Things like the ability just to develop games, to get those games onto service, connect games with players, give them a high quality experience. And going forward, we're building on top of that foundation, but focusing on offering more high quality games in a few key genres and targeting the right cohort of users. So this is a less is more strategy on a few identified verticals. Those verticals include immersive narrative games based on our own IP. You can think about Squid Game Unleashed or Thronglets from the Black Mirror Universe or Golf with Happy Gilmore. We've got games for kids. This is Peppa Pig. No ads, no in-app payments. Safe within your subscription. Mainstream established titles. Think about what we did with Grand Theft Auto, as well as socially engaging party games, which you noted. We're rolling out this holiday season, a slate of party games on TV. It's great for the whole family when you're in front of that TV. All you need is the TV and your phone is a controller. It's like Boggle Party, Pictionary Game Night, Lego Party, Tetris. We've got Party Crashers, which is a social deception game. And the part that I like most about this is these games are super easy to access. It's just like our series and films. You scroll the games tab, you pick whatever you want, click it, and you're in. You don't need a special controller. That's key to this access. And in the years ahead, actually, speaking of controllers, we expect creators will really find interesting and novel ways to unlock all of the power that is in this incredibly advanced controller that we all happen to have in our pockets, which of course is our phones. So we're just starting to scratch the surface today. We think there's much more we can ultimately do in this space. Yet we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the story, but it creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the non-interactive side. It drives engagement, it drives retention, therefore supports the business. So looking ahead, we're going to ramp our investment in this area judiciously based on demonstrating that we're ramping returns to the business, but we're extremely excited about the progress we've got ahead of us. I would say do not play Boggle with Greg. He's very, very good. Honestly, he's our head of the games unit, but he's good. He has a leg up on us. He's very good. He does. I think he gets to play quite often. All right. We have another question from Steve Cahill of Wells Fargo. Last quarter, you talked about Netflix being a great place for some creators on YouTube. Since then, you've announced one new creator deal with Mark Rober. Should we expect more on this front and what kinds of content are you looking for? Thanks, Steve. I said before, but we want to be in business with the best creators on the planet, wherever they are. And some of them are in Hollywood, some of them are in Korea, some of them are in Paris, and some of them are sitting on social media platforms and have yet to be discovered. So not everything on YouTube is a fit for us, but there are some creators like Mark Rober, like Miss Rachel, that are great fits for us. And remember, working with content creators from other platforms isn't a recent thing for us. Folks remember over the years, we made Hype House. We partnered with Miranda Sings. She had a stand-up comedy special and a series called Haters Back Off. King Bach, who's a big star on social media. You can see him in a lot of our films. Babysitter of Killer Queen, when we first met, just to name a few. We we also created a curated section of video podcasts as well. So some of this stuff is just a very natural expansion. And there's plenty of room for the world's best creators wherever they are. Great. We'll now wrap up with our last topic, which is Gen.ai and two sort of questions or maybe a two-part question. The first part comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan, who's asking, how has your thinking evolved over the past couple of years about Netflix's ability to leverage AI? And related, John Hulik at UBS asks, what are your thoughts on the impact from Sora 2 and other new AI content creation apps in terms of increased competition from short form video? Do you think it creates new competition from an engagement standpoint? Perhaps I'll kick it off in the first part of that question. And our thinking about AI hasn't really changed over a decade and a half more. We've had a long history of developing ML and AI solutions. We've got deep DNA, technology DNA, got significant data assets, we've got scaled consumer products, scaled business processes, all of that we think enables us to have the opportunity to leverage new technical capabilities as they come online. And that's our job. We're engaging proactively to do so. As we said in the letter, specifically with GEN.AI, we see a huge number of places in the business where we can bring these technologies in. They provide more capable tools. They improve productivity. They improve velocity of innovation. They deliver better results for members, for creators, for partners. The vast majority of those cases involve us going to market for solutions and just integrating them into our existing tools and products. But there are a few spaces where we think that making targeted investments is important. We think we can develop often using building blocks from others. So think about this as foundational models that we get open source or commercially to make cutting edge tools and cutting edge experiences. And those targeted areas of investment are better product experiences, content production and advertising. And maybe Ted, you want to pick it up on the content creation apps part of the question. Yeah, look, what we've seen so far from these content creation apps is that it's likely to have a lot more impact on UGC creators the most in the near term. In other words, AI content replacing viewing of existing user-generated content. That starts to make sense. But for what we do, it takes a great artist to make something great. Writing and making shows and films well is a rare commodity, and it's only done successfully by very few people. So AI can give creatives better tools to enhance their overall TV movie experience for our members, but it doesn't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not. So if music is a leading indicator of all this, AI-generated music has been around for a long time, and there's a lot of it. And it's a pretty small part of total listening, and established artists like Taylor Swift continue to be more popular than ever. So even in a world filled with AI music, AI seems to be mostly a tool for musicians to take their sound in new directions. And so we're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster, and in new ways. We're all in on that. But we're not chasing novelty for novelty's sake here. And we're investing in what we believe delivers value for creators and members alike. So we're not worried about AI replacing creativity. But we're very excited about AI creating tools to help creativity. Great. Thank you all for your questions. So we're now out of time. So we thank you for joining us for our 2-3 call and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.",
